"""Unsigned variable-length integers.

Encode and decode unsigned varints to and from bytes.

Examples:
    encode(integer)
    decode(buffer)
    decode(big_buffer, limit=math.inf)
    expect(3, buffer_with_multiple_values)

Specification:

    1. Unsigned integers are serialized 7 bits at a time,
       starting with the least significant bits
    2. The most significant bit (msb) in each output byte
       indicates if there is a continuation byte (msb = 1)
    3. There are no signed integers
    4. Integers are minimally encoded
